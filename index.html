        <b>Karate,</b> unarmed martial-arts discipline employing kicking, striking, and defensive blocking with arms and legs. Emphasis is on concentrating as much of the body’s power as possible at the point and instant of impact. Striking surfaces include the hands (particularly the knuckles and the outer edge), ball of the foot, heel, forearm, knee, and elbow. All are toughened by practice blows against padded surfaces or wood. Pine boards up to several inches in thickness can be broken by the bare hand or foot of an expert. Timing, tactics, and spirit, however, are each considered at least as important as physical toughening.

        In sporting karate and sparring (kumite) in training, blows and kicks are stopped short, preferably within an inch of contact. Sporting matches commonly last about three minutes, to a decision, if neither contestant has scored a clean “killing” point in the estimation of the judges. Contests of form (kata) are also held, in which single competitors perform predetermined series of movements simulating defense and counterattack against several opponents. Performances are scored by a panel of judges, as in gymnastics.

        Karate evolved in East Asia over a period of centuries, becoming systematized in Okinawa in the 17th century, probably by people forbidden to carry weapons. It was imported into Japan in the 1920s. Several schools and systems developed, each favouring somewhat different techniques and training methods. Karate, like other Asian martial-arts disciplines, stresses mental attitude, rituals of courtesy, costumes, and a complex ranking system (by colour of belt). There is some overlapping of technique with other fighting styles.

    <h1>Founder of the foundation of the modern Shotokan style</h1>
    
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        Master Gigo Funakoshi (Yoshitaka Funakoshi), the third son of Master Gichin Funakoshi, is credited with developing the foundation of the modern Shotokan karate style. What he introduced to the modern Shotokan style:

        <li>From long-range, high-strike techniques, to very low, long stance techniques.</li>
        <li>Kicks to the upper body (mawashi geri, yoko geri kekomi, yoko geri keage, fumikiri, ura mawashi geri, ushiro ura mawashi geri and ushiro geri kekomi).</li>
        <li>Weight lifting techniques (fudo dachi, yoko geri, and mae geri).</li>
        <li>Kiba dachi instead of shiko dachi and kokutsu dachi instead of nekoashi dachi.</li>
        <li>Most kicking techniques are performed with a high knee lift.</li>
        <li>In blocking techniques (Uke waza), turning the waist area to the side (Hanmi), and pushing the back leg and hip in executing techniques.</li>
        <li>From standing techniques to fast and accurate attacks in kumite, and using verse to knock the opponent down (Ashi Barai) to introduce the artist. His modifications were inspired by the fighting styles of Kendo and Iai Do.</li>

        The lifespan of Guru Gigo Funakoshi, who made a great contribution to the modern Shotokan style, was only 39 years. But the mission he did in that small time is very valuable. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis at the age of 7. Later, he cured the condition through constant karate training. But in 1945, his illness worsened during World War II and he passed away at a very young age on November 24, 1945. Although his name was Yoshitaka Funakoshi, he was known by the names Gigo and Waka.

    <h1>What is a Sensei in Karate?</h1>
    
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        Many people misunderstand the meaning of the word 'sensei' in karate. Although a layman might assume that the word 'sensei' in karate has a complex meaning, its meaning is quite simple. All you need is the interest to know it. Here it is explained very simply.
    </p>
    
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        In karate, sensei is a name attributed to a karate instructor or teacher. Sensei is originally a Japanese word meaning 'person born before'. But in karate, a teacher means a teacher who has experience before his students.
    </p>
    
    <h2 style="font-size:20px;">What is a Sensei in Karate?</h2>
    
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        As we mentioned earlier, sensei in karate is a name used to address a karate teacher. However, it is important to note that the name can only be used from the students' perspective. Often people use the sensei and the first or last name of the teacher they are addressing.
    </p>
    
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        For example: "Sensei JOHN", or "JOHN Sensei". Becoming a sensei takes time and a lot of effort, and it's a wide range, so it's satisfying for a person to have multiple roles aside from teaching. Sensei always holds leadership positions where he selflessly serves others. Sensei tend to perform better in critical areas of life and face challenges with courage. He must be an ideal character or someone who works hard for it. There should be no hidden goals in the sensei because he or she is a guide to the future of the students, a change in attitude, and to set their future life vision.

    <h1>Discipline that a martial arts student must possess and develop</h1>
    
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        Here I am primarily talking about students studying martial arts. There is a system of discipline inherent in martial arts. We call it its code of ethics (Rei Gee). But what I am talking about here is to explain some simple things that we all know beyond Rei Gee under this topic.

    <h1>Constant Training</h1>

        As seen in the image here, we see a very small amount of ice. But a large part of it is submerged in the sea. Because of this submergence, the iceberg remains very stable for a long time. In the martial arts that we study, the most visible thing is the achievements of champions and the promotion of ranks, but the quality and existence of all of these depends on constant training.
    </p>
    
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        Championship wins, grade promotion etc. are also required. It provides the necessary motivation to keep you engaged in the work. But don't enter martial arts just for the sake of it. It is important to implement both of those things properly. "If you think only of hitting, springing, striking, or touching the enemy, you will not be able to actually cut him."
